## Resubmission

This is a resubmission, in this version I have: 

* Added more detail in the Description text about the packages functionality. 
* Added references in the Description text. Because the package is primarily comprised of wrapper functions, I added @seealso tags to those that they call. 
* Updated the title to be more descriptive. This includes removing P8120 from the title. 

## Test enivronments

* Ubuntu 14.05 (Travis CI), R 3.6.0
* local Windows, R 3.6.0

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORS or WARNINGS. 

1 Note: This is the package's first submission. 

* "Maintainer: 'Nick Williams <ntwilliams.personal@gmail.com>  New Submission"

## Downstream dependencies

There are no downstreatm dependencies.
