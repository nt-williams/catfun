Description: Includes wrapper functions around existing functions for the analysis of categorical data and introduces functions for calculating risk differences and matched odds ratios. R currently supports a wide variety of tools for the analysis of categorical data. However, many functions are spread across a variety of packages with differing syntax and poor compatibility with each another. prop_test() combines the functions binom.test(), prop.test() and BinomCI() into one output. prop_power() allows for power and sample size calculations for both balanced and unbalanced designs. riskdiff() is used for calculating risk differences and matched_or() is used for calculating matched odds ratios. For further information on methods used that are not documented in other packages see Nathan Mantel and William Haenszel (1959) <doi:10.1093/jnci/22.4.719> and Alan Agresti (2002) <ISBN:0-471-36093-7>.
